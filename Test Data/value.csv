Even though I have completed advanced improvisational comedy courses at a New York City theater, performed an improv stand-up routine during a student showcase that is till getting me recognition weeks later, and studied comedy extensively, I was never given so much as a call-back to Improvibilities (who aren't funny or following the correct Herald format for their shows). Two years in a row, they have selected my scenepartners to join because only take trendy white hipsters. They don't have black or Latino members or friends. I wasn't considered cool enough to participate in improv and Bowdoin Cable Network was't running and when it finally started to pick back up, it et once during my Tuesday night class before fizzling out. Bowdoin needs to preserve strong leaderships and promote inclusiveness in its campus organizations and post vacancies for students to sustain clubs.","If it hadn't been for the flexibility of English literature electives, I probably would have given up on Bowdoin. The courses in interracial literature, contemporary film, and humor have sustained my interest in pursuing an education here and introduced m to the most brilliant, interesting, and personable professors. Most of my other classes were boring or taught by professors who were too self-involved or managed to go the entire semester without lecturing on the actual course material.","None. Every sports team was unfriendly, mean, or full of gossipy liars and the clubs that interested me didn't welcome me.",Guy Mark Foster promotes cultural perspective and understanding in his classes while advancing complex analyses of textual representations of social issues to a greater extent than anyone at Bowdoin and anyone I have ever met. I've had so many bad experieces with apathetic professors or well-meaning professors whose classes are overrun by rude students that are almost forgiven by my time with Professor Foster.,1,,,-1
